    Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) is Microsoft's next-generation tool for developing
    rich user interfaces, including the ability to render UI elements in 3D. Learn the
    basics of building 3D objects and viewing 3D scenes in WPF. See a real WPF application
    render a 3D scene from real data. With a touch of 3D theory, this session will drill
    into the .Net 3.0 classes and XAML used to construct 3D meshes and models.

    Developing for Windows Vista using Visual Studio 2005
</h2>
<p>
    There's more to Windows Vista than Glass and Sidebar. Learn what Vista has to offer
    you as the developer, what you can take advantage of to enhance your customers user
    experience and how you leverage many of these new features using the tools you have
    today. This presentation is more about the features in Windows Vista, how you can
    leverage them and how you can interact with them using interoperability; as many
    of the new features in Vista are not .NET native (such as Aero/DWM, Windows Experience
    Index information, etc.). Some examples show how to "skin" the .NET 2.0 TreeView
    control to look and feel like the Vista Explorer / Windows Mail applications and
    modify the behavior of a WinForms menu to show and hide similar to Windows Vista
    counterparts.

<h2>
    Practical iBatis Implementations using C#
</h2>
<p>
    As we all know, the application/database relationship domain is one of the hardest,
    most time consuming, and complex areas of applications. iBatis is one solution that
    is filling the gap and making these relationships as painless as possible. iBatis
    consists of two pieces. One which allows robust mapping between database and application
    domain objects. As well as another piece that provides abstraction of the data access
    layer all together. iBatis is a good greenfield development tool, however, it's
    even more useful in legacy system additions and rewrites, when connecting to existing
    databases where the schema can't be changed.

    Reflection in .NET: Hacking and Futzing With IL
</h2>

<p>
    Reflection is a powerful way to dynamically inspect assembies at run-time to determine
    the structure of its contents, invoke methods, and change private field values (among
    other interesting tricks). But it doesn't stop there - .NET gives you the power
    to create code at run-time via its reflection infrastructure as well. In this presentation,
    I'll cover the essentials of the System.Reflection namespace (along with the changes
    that were added in 2.0), how to emit code at run-time, and other libraries that
    go far beyond what .NET can currently provide (FxCop's CCI library for introspection
    and Mono.Cecil for full assembly reading/writing).

    An Introduction to Subversion
</h2>
<p>
    Many Windows developers have used Visual SourceSafe their entire career. Most of
    us know there are other source code control tools out there but have never had any
    exposure to them. In this session I will introduce Subversion, a free, open source
    version control system. First we will take a look at what tools are available for
    use with Subversion (command line, TortoiseSVN, AnkhSVN). Next we will cover some
    basic concepts about versioning models and Subversion's implementation and then
    walk though how a developer works with Subversion on a daily basis. After looking
    at daily developer usage we will dive into some more advanced topics Subversion
    administrators will need to understand and power users will want to know about including
    branching, merging, creating and applying patches, repository setup and structuring,
    and integration with issue tracking systems.

    There Must be Fifty Ways to Unit Test Your Software

<p>
    Unit testing is a critical activity in producing quality software. Developers should
    apply unit testing in parallel to the development of the software. Because unit
    testing is so important, it should be easy to perform unit testing. The developer
    should be able to focus on the "what" the unit tests demonstrates rather than the
    "how" to demonstrate the result. There are a fairly large number of unit testing
    tools that can greatly simplify the unit testing process. Many of these tools are
    free. This session would include a "dash" of unit testing philosophy plus a lot
    of code that demonstrates the use the "core" unit testing harnesses such as NUnit,
    MbUnit, and MsTest as well as related testing tools such as NUnitForms and NUnitASP.
    The session will also address the use of tools to replace dependent elements with
    dummy units, stub units, and mock units. The types of units to be tested will include:
    Logic, Window Forms, Web Pages, Databases, XML Files, JavaScript, and Ajax functionality.

<h2>
    What Ruby on Rails can Teach .NET Developers
</h2>
<p>
    Ask a Rails developer how she would tackle a simple business problem. She'll tell
    you. Put your database scripts here, your functional tests here, html markup here,
    controller logic here, your unit tests here, and put your model here. To validate
    your model, add a few lines here. And because of some simple and reasonable naming
    conventions, it all plays well together. Ask a .Net developer how to tackle the
    same business problem. She'll start thinking. Well, the UI seems pretty obvious,
    but from there it gets difficult. You might start by doing the "simplest thing that
    can possibly work," and drag a dataset onto your screen. But where do you put your
    database scripts? And how do you test your business logic? Or your UI controller
    logic? And how do you name things? If this developer has been around for a while,
    she probably has a few favorite patterns in her toolbox. Maybe she's even got some
    of the pieces covered with reusable code libraries. But she doesn't have a solid,
    well-tested, common framework for completing even a simple business scenario. She
    should! In this presentation, we'll describe how Rails removes many of the common
    barriers to getting real work done – and discuss how the .Net community might do
    the same.
