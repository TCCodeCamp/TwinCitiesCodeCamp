<h2>
    NuGet: From Concepts to Implementation - <a href="@Url.Content("~/Speakers/Spring2012#sp1")">Vince Bullinger</a>
</h2>
<p>
    NuGet is a relatively new package management tool for the .Net framework. While
    many of us have used it, not many of us have really looked too deeply into it. In
    this talk, we'll learn what NuGet is, how to use it, how to get the most out of
    it, how to build your own NuGet package and host it on your own NuGet feed.

    Targeting Mobile Devices with HTML5 and CSS 3 - <a href="@Url.Content("~/Speakers/Spring2012#sp2")">
        Robert
        Boedigheimer
    </a>
</h2>
<p>
    Mobile devices adoption rates have been amazing, including smartphone sales passing
    sales for PCs. Does your web site work well on mobile devices? Do you want to leverage
    your web development skills to provide mobile solutions to a broad range of devices
    rather than learn how to develop in multiple languages for multiple device platforms?
    Learn how HTML5 and CSS 3 are dramatically changing the capabilities of web sites
    on mobile devices, and how you can adapt your web site to be not just available
    but efficient across a broad array of devices.

<h2>
    Extensible, Durable JavaScript with Inheritance - <a href="@Url.Content("~/Speakers/Spring2012#sp4")">
        Mike
        Hodnick
    </a>
</h2>
<p>
    In this session we'll talk about your options to implement inheritance with the
    squirmy, naughty, and very powerful language known as JavaScript. JavaScript has
    moved far beyond tricks like manipulating an HTML DOM and is being used to build
    powerful client-side (and server-side) libraries. As these libraries become more
    complex, inheritance can play a major role in how these libraries are implemented,
    consumed, and customized. With JavaScript's dynamic nature there is more than one
    approach you can take to achieve inheritance. Some of these approaches have performance
    implications, while others are more a matter of taste and style. In this session
    we'll discuss these approaches and which ones are best for different scenarios.

<h2>
    Leveraging jQuery's Special Events API - <a href="@Url.Content("~/Speakers/Spring2012#sp5")">James Greene</a>
</h2>
<p>
    The jQuery JavaScript library has become a household item in the web development
    community. It allows for simple event binding, DOM manipulation, and asynchronous
    requests. Many developers know they can extend jQuery using their simple plugin
    development process ... but did you also know that jQuery is extensible in other
    ways as well? We will focus on extending jQuery's event system via the Special Events
    API in order to create our own custom bindable events, such as "multiclick", "textSelect",
    and "swipe".

<h2>
    Big Data and Healthcare: Wireless Monitoring, Data Storage, and Analysis - <a href="@Url.Content("~/Speakers/Spring2012#sp6")">
        Wade Schultz
    </a> and <a href="@Url.Content("~/Speakers/Spring2012#sp7")">Brent Nelson</a>
</h2>
<p>
    In this session we will cover several topics related to obtaining, storing, and
    analyzing health and fitness data. With the increasing number of cheap, portable
    monitoring devices, individuals can capture and record health-related data almost
    constantly. Unfortunately, few of these devices are capable of integrating or providing
    a useful assessment of the measurements. We will demonstrate how to quickly capture
    data from Bluetooth-enabled devices such as the Wii Balance Board, Zephyr Bioharness,
    and others using both WPF and Android applications. Once the data is captured, we
    will store these real-time results in MongoDB and provide a simple web service secured
    with Windows Identity Foundation (WIF) to access and submit data securely from mobile
    devices. Providing efficient, integrated services such as these will be increasingly
    important in providing the best data and analysis possible to both healthcare providers
    and consumers.

<h2>
    Specification by Example with JBehave - <a href="@Url.Content("~/Speakers/Spring2012#sp8")">Brian Repko</a>
</h2>
<p>
    The ability to communicate requirements via executable specifications is moving
    from bleeding edge to leading edge as team's are seeing it's value for both their
    agile processes as well as their continuous delivery pipeline. This talk will demonstrate
    testing a system's behavior using JBehave - a pure-Java BDD/ATDD tool with a syntax
    similar to Cucumber's Gherkin. We will cover basic stuff up to and including Selenium
    testing with Page Objects.

<h2>
    Using Rails and jQuery Mobile For The (Quick) Win - <a href="@Url.Content("~/Speakers/Spring2012#sp9")">
        Brian
        Hogan
    </a>
</h2>
<p>
    Right now, there's a focus on creating native applications for mobile devices, but
    that can be costly, require a lot of additional time, and may be overkill for what
    you're doing. By combining the flexibility of Ruby on Rails with the ease of use
    of jQuery Mobile, you can develop quality mobile web apps. In this talk, we'll walk
    through creating a simple app, from scratch, that presents both a desktop and mobile
    view, and we'll talk about the ups and downs of this approach. Best of all, no prior
    knowledge of Ruby on Rails is assumed, and you'll have all the source code you need
    to recreate this project on your own.

    </a>
</h2>
<p>
    The what, and how of Windows Server AppFabric caching 1.1. In this talk we will
    work with AppFabric Caching, getting it set up, how to place items in the cache,
    retrieve them, etc. We will talk about using Powershell to create cache, and monitor
    it. We will also talk about the pros and cons of configuration of the AppFabric
    Cache service. If we have time we might go over differences b/w Azure Cache and
    Windows Server Cache.

<h2>
    First Principles of System Architecture - <a href="@Url.Content("~/Speakers/Spring2012#sp17")">Joshua Ramirez</a>
</h2>
<p>
    If part of your job is designing architecture for a system then I'm sure you'll
    find this talk interesting. Many of us find ourselves struggling to keep up with
    the complexity of the evolving systems we support. Have you applied best practices
    but still feel like you could have better - a lot better? I have. Come find out
    what I've been learning about how to achieve some harmony in the design of an enterprise
    system. Find out how the lessons of OOP, SOA, EDA, DDD, CQRS, and other buzzwords
    can be distilled into a core set of first principles. Using these ideas I hope to
    share how to begin thinking about architecture instead of learning how to copy architecture.
    I'll be demonstrating this thinking in practice by walking you through the design
    of an online ordering system, and I'll leave you with the resources you need to
    continue your journey.

<h2>
    Understanding the MVP - Connecting Continuous Delivery to the Lean Startup Movement
    - <a href="@Url.Content("~/Speakers/Spring2012#sp18")">Aaron Erickson</a>
</h2>
<p>
    The minimum? Why would I only want to do the minimum? It seems counter-intuitive
    - the idea that the best path forward when embarking on new product development
    should focus on the smallest possible product. Why not go big and try to launch
    with a big splash? Won't your customers be turned off by a lack of features and
    glorious complexity? As it turns out, taking the path of humility towards your market
    is a far more productive path. You can start with a small hypothesis - test that
    hypothesis against real customers. Using continuous delivery, you can rapidly iterating
    over your product, using data, rather than opinion, to guide your product development
    efforts. Such an approach not only costs less money, it allows you to vet the initiative
    before it becomes "too big to fail". In this session, we will cover what the MVP
    is, how you define one, and how you use validated learning to guide your efforts.
    Further, we will cover how agile software development and continuous delivery are
    essential to product development efforts that use this approach.

<h2>
    Expressing Yourself with C# Expression Trees - <a href="@Url.Content("~/Speakers/Spring2012#sp19")">Chad Kulesa</a>
</h2>
<p>
    Expression trees provide many new options for creating reusable code. Understanding
    expression trees will allow you to extend LINQ providers or even write your own
    LINQ provider. You can also write your own fluent API, removing the need for configuration
    or XML files. It is even possible to turn C# statements into Javascript! We will
    begin the journey of mastering expression trees, and adding this important skill
    to your repertoire.

        Nick
        Schweitzer
    </a>
</h2>
<p>
    Unit testing is a core part of a developers job, and is an important part of software
    quality. All too many times though, Javascript is left out of the unit testing mix.
    Learn how to architect your Javascript to make it more testable, and also how to
    use unit testing frameworks to mock your AJAX calls, create repeatable unit tests,
    and integrate those unit tests with a continuous integration server.

<h2>
    Extending .NET Applications with MEF Plugins - <a href="@Url.Content("~/Speakers/Spring2012#sp23")">J Wynia</a>
</h2>
<p>
    The real world problems we're asked to solve with software are messy, the business
    rules change constantly, and they vary by customer or by context. Moving the things
    that change regularly into plugins lets you keep your core product solid while maintaining
    the flexibility your applications need. We'll use MEF (Managed Extensibility Framework)
    provide that functionality to a simple C# application.

<h2>
    Getting Started with SignalR - <a href="@Url.Content("~/Speakers/Spring2012#sp24")">Rich Dudley</a>
</h2>
<p>
    SignalR is an asynchronous signaling library for ASP.NET. It's designed to help
    you build real-time web applications without a lot of hassle. In the past, developers
    would have to wire up "real-time" applications as a series of polls to a webserver,
    waiting for it to receive data back that was useful. This approach usually cost
    more in bandwidth than we wanted it to. SignalR simplifies this process, and makes
    it more useful for the ASP.NET developer. In this presentation, Kevin Griffin will
    guide you through implementing SignalR into your applications, and how you can take
    advantage of everything it has to offer.

    MVVM with Caliburn.Micro - <a href="@Url.Content("~/Speakers/Spring2012#sp28")">Brent Edwards</a>
</h2>
<p>
    With all the MVVM frameworks out there, it’s hard to know which one is best for
    you. In this session, we will look at one of the best MVVM frameworks out there:
    Caliburn.Micro. We will build an application from the ground up to show how to get
    started with Caliburn.Micro from the perspective that matters the most: the code.

<h2>
    Dart: A Replacement for JavaScript and Why You Should Care - <a href="@Url.Content("~/Speakers/Spring2012#sp29")">
        Kevin Gisi
    </a>
</h2>
<p>
    It's widely regarded that JavaScript becomes a bit of a mess when scaled out to
    large project sizes. Yet the increase of client-side programming, and the advent
    of Node.js has driven us to use this language for lack of other options. Here, we'll
    examine Dart, Google's solution to the problem, and see how it stacks up against
    alternatives like CoffeeScript.

<h2>
    Estimate: reflections on the approximate - <a href="@Url.Content("~/Speakers/Spring2012#sp30")">Avonelle Lovhaug</a>
</h2>
<p>
    "When will it be done?" is the question most dreaded by software developers. You
    may think the most important tools for creating software estimates are a crystal
    ball and a divining rod, but there is a better way that won't involve magic. Plus,
    accurate software development estimates can enhance your professional image in your
    organization, and make life better by eliminating the mad dash at the end of the
    project. This session will improve your estimating accuracy by teaching you several
    techniques that I've learned through my 16+ years as a software consultant. It will
    also show you how to handle situations where an accurate estimate isn't possible.
    Bring your estimating questions and war stories!

<h2>
    Parallel Programming in .NET and Azure - <a href="@Url.Content("~/Speakers/Spring2012#sp31")">Greg Levenhagen</a>
</h2>
<p>
    Parallel programming remains a difficult task, but the .NET framework keeps making
    things easier for developers. With the various constructs available, like the addition
    of the Task Parallel Library in .NET 4, it is important to know what is appropriate
    for different situations. Devices continue to gain cores and the cloud offers easily
    distributed computing, so developers should understand how to utilize the environments.
    Come for a walk-through of how and when to use these constructs, whether that is
    in the cloud, a mobile device, desktop application or the web.

    KnockoutJS and SignalR Mashup to Create Maintainable Real-Time Applications - <a href="@Url.Content("~/Speakers/Spring2012#sp32")">Jason More</a>
</h2>
<p>
    Combining two powerful web technoglies - KnockoutJS (MVVM for the web) and SignalR
    (Async signaling for real-time, multi-user web applications), you can create a web
    application that lets users communicate in real time with minimal development. We'll
    quickly explore simple setup for both, then show how nicely they compliment each
    other. We'll finish with an audience driven game of "Family Feud" built on this
    technology stack.

        Judah Himango
    </a>
</h2>
<p>
    The war's over. Web plugins like Silverlight and Flash have served their purpose
    well, but the native web is now sufficiently powerful to render web plugins superfluous
    and irrelevant. What's a Silverlight developer to do? Enter KnockoutJS. Instead
    of throwing away our existing skills built up through Silverlight, I'll show you
    how to transfer your skills to the native web via KnockoutJS, using familiar technologies
    like data binding, MVVM, templates, and commanding support.

    WebAPI is a new feature in ASP.NET MVC 4 for building HTTP services. Come this session
    to find out why HTTP and WebAPI matter and learn how you can use WebAPI to build
    services. You will learn how WebApi enables you to take full advantage of HTTP including
    caching, content negotiation, and eTags. In addition you will see how WebAPI integrates
    with MVC and how you can use it in a self-host scenario. We’ll cover all the good
    stuff like dependency resolution and unit testing of your services too!

    Islands of Richness: Structuring Rich Client-Side Applications in Javascript - <a href="@Url.Content("~/Speakers/Spring2012#sp42")">Todd H. Gardner</a>
</h2>
<p>
    GMail, Twitter, Turntable; Rich client-side applications are hot! Plus there are
    great advantages to it: highly responsive to the user, minimized network traffic,
    and consolidated rendering logic.
</p>
<p>
    But Javascript tends to decay faster than strongly typed languages. This makes it
    even more important to structure your code in a modular, testable, and maintainable
    way. Modern Javascript libraries like these make structuring your application easier
    than ever!
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Backbone.js -- Model-View-Template structure </li>
    <li>Underscore.js -- General Purpose Javascript Utility</li>
    <li>Require.js -- Dependency Management</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Together, we will build a Javascript web application atop these libraries--exploring
    client-side rendering, managing user state, consuming data, and error handleing.

    Gain Confidence with Continuous Integration - <a href="@Url.Content("~/Speakers/Spring2012#sp43")">Jenna Pederson</a>
</h2>
<p>
    Instead of scheduling time to integrate code at the end of development, learn how
    to integrate often, find and fix bugs early, and improve developer productivity.
    See a popular CI tool in action and learn how the practice of continuous integration
    will give you more confidence in your software so you can start thinking about continuous
    delivery.

    Artificial Evolution, Zombies and JavaScript - <a href="@Url.Content("~/Speakers/Spring2012#sp44")">Allen Sanborn</a>
</h2>
<p>
    Learn a bit about how to use artificial life algorithms and evolutionary algorithms
    to survive the coming zombie apocalypse. Evolutionary algorithms are inspired by
    some mechanisms from biologicial evolution (reproduction, mutation, recombination
    and selection) but aren't hindered by silly little things like how real biological
    systems actually work. We can harness these ideas to solve problems and optimize
    strategies that can help us get through our day to day activities or help us avoid
    having our brains eaten. The presentation will range from fundamental ideas to functional
    demos done in JavaScript (or CoffeeScript).

    Teach Your Kids to Program - <a href="@Url.Content("~/Speakers/Spring2012#sp45")">Tommy Davis</a> and <a href="@Url.Content("~/Speakers/Spring2012#sp46")">Scott Davis</a>
</h2>
<p>
    If you are going to code camp, you likely know how valuable programming skills are,
    and perhaps you one day want your kids to learn these skills too. Programming teaches
    kids many valuable lessons: how to think logically and rationally, how to plan ahead,
    how to problem solve, and how to swear properly. But how do we teach kids to program
    today? When we were kids we were ecstatic to see a green blinking cursor on the
    screen prompting us to type our name so we could have the program print it repeatedly
    on the page while(true). How do we get today’s kids with XBoxes and Nintendos interested
    in rudimentary programming of “if” statements? In this session Tommy Davis (age
    9) and his dad Scott will discuss four programming languages and how they work for
    kids: Scratch, Lego Mindstorms, Python, and C#. We will demonstrate each language
    and talk about Tom’s experience in each, what worked well and what didn’t, and what
    approaches you might take to get your own kids into programming. Tommy attended
    his first Twin Cities Code Camp last fall, where he showed off the Windows Phone
    game he had made before coming to the conference as the youngest programmer in attendance.

    Open Source 101: Get Involved with GitHub - <a href="@Url.Content("~/Speakers/Spring2012#sp47")">Keith Dahlby</a>
</h2>
<p>
    One of the best ways to grow as a developer is to contribute to the ever-growing
    library of open source software, either with your own project or by working on an
    existing one. In this session we'll talk through some of the reasons you should
    get involved, and then take a closer look at how that process works with Git and
    GitHub.

    CSLA .NET and Windows 8 - <a href="@Url.Content("~/Speakers/Spring2012#sp48")">Rockford Lhotka</a>
</h2>
<p>
    Windows 8 offers the exciting new “Windows Runtime (WInRT)” platform for application
    development. This new platform is similar to Silverlight in many ways, though it
    also supports JavaScript and C++ technologies in addition to .NET. CSLA .NET is
    a widely used open source framework for building reusable business logic in .NET
    that can run on .NET, Silverlight, Windows Phone, and Android. In this talk you
    will learn how CSLA .NET is being enhanced to support the new WinRT platform as
    well, allowing you to take your existing CSLA-based business logic and simply recompile
    it for use in building WinRT applications.
