    Introduction to BASH Shell Scripting - <a href="@Url.Content("~/Speakers/Spring2011#sp5")">Brock Noland</a>
</h2>
<p>
    Many software engineers consider "shell scripting" to be a dark art best left to
    system administrators. In the distributed computing world basic shell-scripting
    knowledge can save you hours of time, per week. In this session we will cover the
    basics of shell scripting by diving right into working solutions, like processing
    logs using shell in a Hadoop cluster, and monitoring for race conditions, gathering
    the required artifacts once the condition is hit. In addition to learn shell scripting
    specific structures such as assigning the output of a command to a variable and
    chaining basic utilities together to accomplish a complex task. Finally, every attendee
    will receive free shell access to a sandbox I run for users to learn shell!

<h2>
    Introduction to Advanced Ruby - <a href="@Url.Content("~/Speakers/Spring2011#sp16")">Brian Hogan</a>
</h2>
<p>
    "Introduction to Ruby" talks aren't that exciting. Every language has strings, arrays,
    conditionals, and evaluation, and by now, everyone's sick of "build a CRUD app in
    15 minutes" demos. Every language has its own special qualities that set it apart,
    and this talk focuses what makes Ruby different and special. We'll cover seven advanced
    language features and techniques, and we'll demonstrate how we use those to solve
    everyday problems. We'll talk about message passing, extending core language features,
    lambdas, and we'll even write a little code that writes code. If you've looked at
    Ruby and thought "What's the point?" then this talk is for you.

    Welcome to NodeJS - <a href="@Url.Content("~/Speakers/Spring2011#sp4")">Marc Harter</a>
</h2>
<p>
    NodeJS is a Server Side JavaScript (SSJS) implementation built off the Google Chrome
    V8 JavaScript engine. It is grown considerably in popularity since its initial public
    release a little over a year ago. Some have called 2011, the "Year of Server Side
    JavaScript." Why? Is it just a fad? What does it offer different from other server
    side languages and frameworks? What makes it stand out? In this talk, we will be
    discussing the answers to those questions as we look at design philosophy behind
    NodeJS. We will also look into its implementation and some demo applications. The
    goal is for you to come away with a clear understanding of what NodeJS is, what
    problems it tries to solve, and how it could be used in your application stack.

    MVVM in the Real World - <a href="@Url.Content("~/Speakers/Spring2011#sp24")">Bryan Anderson</a>
</h2>
<p>
    The Model-View-View Model pattern has become the de facto architecture for applications
    written with WPF and Silverlight for good reason. It makes WPF and Silverlight applications
    easier to write and maintain but sometimes it can be difficult to understand how
    to get a task done or how the pieces all fit together. This session will go over
    the guiding principles of MVVM, explore the responsibilities of each layer, and
    explain the differences between MVVM and MVC. I will focus on the common problems
    teams run into when developing an application and how you can solve them by understanding
    the "How?" and "Why?" of MVVM as well as the "What?" you may have seen before.

    Automated Web Testing in Team System 2010 - <a href="@Url.Content("~/Speakers/Spring2011#sp25")">Jeffrey Byboth</a>
</h2>
<p>
    Manual testing of web applications is expensive and repetitive. Often the QA staff
    does not have the capacity or the project schedule does not include time to do a
    complete regression test of applications for each release. Often when the project
    gets behind the first thing to reduce time on is testing. Using automated web testing
    in Team System 2010 can eliminate much of the repetitive manual validation of web
    sites. Not only can it exercise your web application, but it generates really good
    reports to show to management.
</p>

    A Journey into Mobile Development - <a href="@Url.Content("~/Speakers/Spring2011#sp41")">Brian Hugh</a>
</h2>
<p>
    A year ago, I hopped on the mobile/smartphone band wagon, by picking up a Motorola
    Droid. The original/milestone Droid phone from Motorola. I've been picking up learning
    about "mobile" development and what it means to business and technologist in my
    limited time, juggling multiple projects. The first thing you are faced, when you
    want to explore mobile development, is what platform do you want to target? Apple/IOS,
    Android, Blackberry, WebOS. As a systems integrator, with a number of technologies
    under my belt, the question was how to you reach more than one platform. What I
    discovered, is the web based frameworks and html5 are starting to emerge. Yes, these
    frameworks are still a little on the bleeding edge of things, but isn't that what
    all the fun is about? Get a peek into some of the emerging frameworks in this area.
    These frameworks include jQuery Mobile, Sencha, Titanium, SproutCore, PhoneGap,
    Rhodes are a few of the leading/bleeding frameworks that let you target multiple
    platforms. This won't be a deep dive, but will be a mid-level overview of some of
    these frameworks and my journey.

    Visual Studio took over 43 MILLION lines of code to write – it's big. Really BIG.
    There is no way that a single developer can know everything about Visual Studio
    that will be useful. That's where this session comes in. We'll cover a plethora
    of shortcuts, strategies, hidden features and freeware that will save you a gigantic
    amount time when developing your .Net application with Visual Studio. Beginners
    and advanced programmers alike will walk away saying, "I didn't know you could to
    that!"

<p>
    This session covers the more complex debugging scenarios in Visual Studio including
    to address debugging more complex scenarios. We'll start with setting breakpoints
    (absolute, conditional, and advanced). Next, we'll discuss capturing debug output
    with the System.Diagnostic.Debug statement, how and when to do tracing and logging,
    debugging web pages, and analyzing log files with parsing and filtering. We'll move
    to debugging performance issues using timers within the code and using Visual Studio
    performance analysis. Finally, we'll finish with dealing with memory leaks; what
    are the typical causes and solutions, using the .NET garbage collector to hunt down
    the problems, and using SOS to poke around in memory during execution.

<p>
    With the proliferation of the plethora of iOS devices making there way into the
    enterprise, it's only a matter of time before your enterprise applications will
    have to be supported on iOS devices. If the vast majority of the enterprise code
    you already have is in C#, why learn develop in Objective C when the language you
    have the majority of your experience in is waiting for you. This session will walk
    through an application that is built to run on both the iPad and the iPod/iPhone
    platform, utilizing enterprise web services and approximating a standard enterprise
    application.

    Become Comfortable with WCF Systems Design - <a href="@Url.Content("~/Speakers/Spring2011#sp47")">Joshua Ramirez</a>
</h2>
<p>
    WCF is rapidly gaining popularity as a tool to create modern web services, but can
    it help you accomplish more? In actuality, WCF is a framework designed to help you
    develop robust service oriented applications and systems. Many developers find themselves
    suddenly tasked with building a system using WCF and can become overwhelmed with
    the scope of the WCF Framework. Fortunately, WCF is easily embraced when theres
    an overall understanding of how the capabilities are organized. In this presentation
    we'll first cover the capabilities of WCF and how they align to currently well known
    integration strategies. Next, we'll consider some common challenges you'll encounter
    when developing enterprise applications and systems with WCF. Lastly, we'll learn
    a few of the common scenarios you'll find yourself working with in the real world.
