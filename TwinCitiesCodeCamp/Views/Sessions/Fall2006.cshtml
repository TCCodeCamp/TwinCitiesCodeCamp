<h2>
    SharePoint as a Development Platform
</h2>
<p>
    <a href="NeilIversen.zip">Content</a>
</p>
<p>
    Looking at whether you should use SharePoint? Already decided to but now you have
    to code for it? This presentation will help you get off to a great start. SharePoint
    is a lot bigger than documents and lists and this presentation will be an introduction
    to developing against it. We'll cover the object model by creating a web part, using
    the web services from a Windows form app and how to use RPC to perform actions that
    the web services don.t support. We'll also discuss how to take advantage of the
    relationship between SharePoint and ASP.net.

<h2>
    Managing Memory in a Managed World
</h2>
<p>
    <a href="ChadYost.zip">Content</a>
</p>
<p>
    Managed memory is a wonderful thing. No longer having to worry about deleting pointers,
    leaking memory, having enough space available, it is all taken care of for you by
    the Garbage Collector. But what happens when a large amount of your data is large
    enough that it needs to go into the large object heap. How do you make sure that
    you are not fragmenting it so much that the next request to get data has space?
    How do you make sure that these large pieces of data are not mapped into the address
    space all the time, taking up valuable space in the 2GB limit?
</p>
<p>
    This presentation will focus on some specific functionality that Thomson-West implemented
    to handle large legal documents (MB of XML), that can be slow to retrieve via soap
    in a manner that kept them out of the large object heap. Discussion will center
    on implementing a soap extension that generically parses a soap response to pull
    out the large strings, pushing them to the Virtual Heap, instead of placing them
    on the large object heap.

<h2>
    Foundations of Ajax
</h2>
<p>
    Seemingly overnight, Ajax has gone from an obscure acronym to, well, having conferences
    devoted to it. People are often surprised when they learn that Ajax isn't really
    anything new - so if it's yesterday's technology, why all the hype? This talk will
    examine the course of events that led up to the current love affair with richer
    client applications. We'll talk examine the technologies that power an Ajax application
    and discuss how to work with them - and then we'll examine a number of frameworks
    that will do much of the heavy lifting for us!
</p>
<p>
    Once we understand the techniques of Ajax, we'll touch on where (and where not)
    it's appropriate for your application finishing off with some common gotchas.

    Minnesota. For the last several years, he has focused on user interface design.
    A long-time member of the Association for Computing Machinery's Computer-Human Interaction
    Special Interest Group, Nathaniel believes that if the user can't figure out your
    application, then you've done something wrong. Along with his user interface work,
    Nathaniel is the cocreator of the open-source Taconite framework, has contributed
    to two corporate Java frameworks, has developed training material, and has led several
    study groups. During the brief moments of warm weather found in his home state of
    Minnesota, he spends as much time on the golf course as his wife will tolerate.
    He's currently exploring Ruby, Rails, and (after recently making the switch) Mac
    OS X. Nathaniel is the coauthor of the bestselling book, Foundations of Ajax.

<h2>
    REST and its Discontents
</h2>
<p>
    Representational State Transfer or REST has gained a lot of mind share as an alternative
    to SOAP-based web services. REST describes a resource-based architecture that mirrors
    the web. "It's just XML over HTTP" is a common refrain. But as you did deeper, REST
    becomes more complicated. Debates about the "right" and "wrong" ways to do REST
    get hot and heavy fast. What are the advantages and disadvantages of REST? Who's
    doing REST right and who's doing it wrong? We'll cut through the chaff, and show
    you how you can use REST in your web services.

    JRuby: Ruby on the JVM
</h2>
<p>

</p>
<p>
    The Ruby language has turned the corner and started to explode into mainstream development.
    There are now over seven implementations of Ruby for all the major VMs and several
    other platforms. JRuby is a 100% Java implementation of Ruby targetting the JVM,
    designed to enable Java developers to use Ruby as a first-class language and also
    to enable Ruby developers a powerful drop-in replacement for the standard C-based
    interpreter. JRuby has made great progress toward matching Ruby in compatibility
    and performance, and already can run popular applications like Rails. This session
    will give an introduction to JRuby, JRuby on Rails, and what the future holds for
    Ruby on the JVM.

    and he has spent the past two years helping the JRuby project achieve its performance
    and compatibility goals. He joined Sun Microsystems in September 2006 and has since
    worked fulltime on JRuby and other alternative language initiatives at the company.
    Charles believes that all true developers will always want and need multiple languages,
    and that language diversity is now a requirement for all VMs.

<h2>
    Securing Web Services in WCF
</h2>
<p>
    <a href="JeffKnutson.zip">Content</a>
</p>
<p>
    You're a developer, you <b>love</b> security, right? No one can read your XML messages
    or tamper with their contents, right? Ok, I know many developers hate security because
    it's "hard" and it "gets in the way" of getting their already late projects done
    on time. Security is here to stay whether you like it or not! The good news for
    web service developers is that the WCF team has put a great deal of work baking
    security into the framework so you don't have to be a security expert to "get security
    right". This talk will demonstrate techniques in WCF that all of us overworked and
    underpaid developers can use to spend less time securing and more time building
    the web service.

<h2>
    The State of Languages on the CLR
</h2>
<p>
    It's true that most .NET developers use either C# and/or VB. However, other languages
    have been targeted for the CLR, such as Python, Ruby, F#, Eiffel, and others. This
    session will cover how these languages work when they're running in the .NET world.

<p>
    The new kid on the block of web platforms is Ruby on Rails. We've heard about it,
    dabbled in it, and might have considered using it in some our solutions… but one
    of the hesitations comes from integration. How will it work with existing data?
    How will it work with existing .NET applications and libraries? The answers are
    out there ... and this discussion will lead you to examples on how you can do integration
    (both ways) between Ruby on Rails and .Net. You'll see how you can easily invoke
    / publish web services, databases, and libraries between the two. Come check out
    what all the hype is about and expand your toolbox to help provide better solutions
    to your problems.
