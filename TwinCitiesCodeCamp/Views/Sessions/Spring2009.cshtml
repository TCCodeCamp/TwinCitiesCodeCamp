<h2>
    Developing for Windows Mobile Devices
</h2>
<p>
    Mobile development is growing fast, and Windows Mobile is at the forefront with
    over 18 million phones shipped last year and many more cutting-edge devices on the
    way. Visual Studio developers have tremendous opportunities in this space. Why?
    Developing for a Windows Mobile phone leverages your existing coding experience
    and takes it to new heights. In this session, we'll look at some of the coolest
    new devices, you'll learn how to set up Visual Studio with the latest SDK and device
    emulators, and you'll see how to build, deploy and debug Windows Mobile applications.
    We'll work with building a realistic application, working with data and finally
    packaging it up.

<h2>
    DemoFEST: SQL 2008, AJAX and the Virtual Earth SDK
</h2>
<p>
    In DemoFest events, we demonstrate an end-to-end solution that takes technologies
    and tools we discussed in other BenkoTips webcasts and applies them to create something
    fun. We look at some of the new features in Microsoft SQL Server 2008, including
    data types for spatial data, and how we can use these features to build interesting
    applications. We then take this functionality and expose it using a Windows Communication
    Foundation (WCF) service. Finally, we explore the software development kit (SDK)
    for Microsoft Virtual Earth and how we can build on top of this rich interactive
    platform using new Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) and JavaScripting capabilities
    in Microsoft Visual Studio 2008.

<h2>
    Practical Parallelism
</h2>
<p>
    With multi-core computers becoming commonplace, and technologies like Silverlight
    requiring the use of asynchronous programming, and the use of distributed service-based
    computing spreading, we are entering an era where parallel and concurrent programming
    is virtually required. Are you ready to be multi-threaded? Parallel? Concurrent?
    Are you ready to build applications that are not only parallel, but distributed?
    This session will discuss the drivers of this change, the challenges we face, and
    some of the solutions available today and in the near future on the Microsoft .NET
    platform.

<h2>
    Self-Writing Programs - Using Expressions in C# to Write Code that Writes Code
</h2>
<p>
    While most of us were looking at new features like Linq when C# 3.0 and VB9 came
    out, behind the scenes, a much more interesting and powerful feature snuck in -
    the ability to write programs that literally write themselves! In this session,
    we explore how to write programs that write themselves using the classes in the
    System.Linq.Expressions namespace. These classes allow you to evaluate code at runtime
    and even write new code at runtime - without having to resort to IL generation (why
    should Lisp hackers get all the fun?). You will learn how to use the classes in
    the namespace, how they work together, as well as some examples of how such things
    can be useful in ordinary line of business applications.

<h2>
    Rails and Legacy Databases
</h2>
<p>
    Have you been to Ruby on Rails talks and found the framework interesting? Do you
    want to use Ruby on Rails for your next project but have to connect to a legacy
    database and don't know if Rails will work? Rails' object relational mapping allows
    to connect to legacy databases easily and use rails conventions to build your web
    application, without disrupting the database. During this talk we will look at a
    very hideous database (something that I hope no one will ever see) and build a simple
    rails application on top of it. This demo will revolve around using SQL Server 2005.

<h2>
    Real World ASP.NET MVC
</h2>
<p>
    With the addition of the new ASP.NET MVC framework there will be a lot of questions
    surrounding how this technology can be used instead of the Web Forms that we all
    have been used to since .NET 1.0. With the addition of the MVC Framework we now
    have the best of the old world ASP Classic, with a compiled and easier to debug
    workspace. This session will cover a quick overview of the MVC framework, and continue
    with building a 'Real World' application. The message that will be carried from
    within the session will be how the MVC Framework can be harnessed in future projects
    within the attendee's future projects. This will be a "Must See" session for any
    web developer looking to the future.

<h2>
    Implementing Presentation Patterns that Truly Work Across Platforms
</h2>
<p>
    <a href="http://tinyurl.com/c7r4s3" target="_blank">Presentation Materials</a>
</p>
<p>
    In layered applications, the presentation layer is just as important as navigation
    logic, business logic, and data access. While you should try to keep the presentation
    layer independent from the UI technology and platform in order to improve testability,
    it's not always easy to do. Design patterns can help. In this session I'll discuss
    design patterns such as Model View Controller (MVC) and Model View Presenter (MVP)
    for building presentation layers that can truly be used across multiple platforms,
    including WPF, Silverlight and Windows Mobile, and in Software as a Service (SaaS)
    scenarios.

<h2>
    A Walk on the Wild Side: Imposing Structure on an Unstructured World
</h2>
<p>
    <a href="http://blog.magenic.com/blogs/jons/archive/2009/04/19/Spring-2009-Code-Camp-Software-Solution.aspx"
       target="_blank">Presentation Materials</a>
</p>
<p>
    One definition of programming is the extraction of formal structure from unstructured
    situations. The "real world" is chaotic. When we develop software, we abstract from
    this messy maelstrom to build database tables and software objects that are, at
    least relatively, more structured. But it is impossible to eliminate the mess. Anyone
    who writes that part of the application that accepts data at the "edge" of the application
    knows just how messy it can be. There are three ways that the application design
    can respond to the data entry problem:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Reduce the complexity of the data entry by requiring the user to parse the data
        into individual textboxes that are so simple as to be un-interesting. If you build
        applications this way, turn your head away in shame. Stand tall and say, "I will
        not make my users do work that the computer software can and should be doing."
    </li>
    <li>
        Build logic to parse the mess and extract as much of the meaning from the maelstrom.
        This is fun, interesting, and useful. There are several ways of doing this and each
        way leads to lots of opportunities to show you some code.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add structure under the covers by using "micro formats". Again, this is a good
        thing that lends itself to more opportunities to show you some code.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Just so you won't think parsing and micro formats are only for the "fancy folk",
    we will look at parsing and micro formats to deal with common data entry items such
    as addresses and phone numbers. These "ordinary data entry problems" can be very
    difficult to solve in the general case. We will parse these items with regular expressions,
    programmatic state machines, and formal parsers, noting the wonders and woes of
    each approach. Once you have struggled with handing the entry of these items, you
    should be motivated to make it easier for others by tagging your output using "micro
    formats" that vastly reduce the effort for other programs to accept the output your
    applications produce.

    Ruby's monkeypatching brought the idea of metaprogramming to the masses, or at least
    to those that weren't exposed to it in Lisp or C. At its best, metaprogramming can
    greatly improve productivity, as is the case with Grails, but at its worst it can
    destroy expectations and induce versioning confusion. This talk introduces the myriad
    metaprogramming techniques Groovy and dynamic typing allows, shows how some of them
    are used in real life, and compares them to what's available in other languages.
    Oh yeah, all code will be written live.
